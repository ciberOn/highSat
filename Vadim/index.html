            <h1>You are in a desolate city street, surrounded by ruins and debris. The sky is a deep shade of crimson,
                and the air is thick with the smell of smoke and ozone. The alien invasion has been going on for hours,
                and it seems like the world as you knew it is on the brink of collapse.

                You've managed to find a small group of survivors, including a young nurse named Sarah, a former soldier
                named Jack, and a brilliant scientist named Dr. Patel. You've barricaded yourselves inside a abandoned
                building, trying to catch your breath and come up with a plan.

                As you peek out the window, you see a group of aliens patrolling the street. They're tall, slender
                creatures with long arms and large, black eyes. They seem to be scanning the area, searching for any
                signs of human life.
            </h1>
            <a href="#1" class="link f_var">You remember a nearby armory that might have some heavy
                artillery to take down the aliens. It's a risk, but it could be worth it.</a>
            <a href="#2" class="link s_var">You need to get your group to safety. You spot a nearby building
                that looks like it might be secure. It's not ideal, but it's better than staying out in the open.
            </a>
            <a href="#3" class="link t_var">You're not going to let the aliens take over without a fight. You grab
                a nearby gun and prepare to take on the invaders head-on.

            <h1> remember a nearby armory that might have some heavy artillery to take down the aliens. It's a risk, but
                it could be worth it. You sprint through the deserted streets, dodging debris and avoiding the eerie
                gazes of the alien's surveillance drones. The armory's sign creaks in the wind as you approach the
                entrance, a faded logo of a proud eagle now a mocking reminder of humanity's crumbling defenses.

                As you burst through the door, the dimly lit interior reveals rows of steel shelves stacked with crates
                and dusty weapon racks. The air is thick with the smell of gunpowder and stale sweat. You navigate the
                narrow aisles, your footsteps echoing off the metal walls. Your eyes scan the shelves, searching for
                anything that might give you an edge against the extraterrestrial invaders.

            <h1>You quickly rally your group and make a dash for the building, keeping a close eye out for any signs of
                alien activity. As you approach the entrance, you notice that the door is slightly ajar, and you can't
                shake the feeling that something is off. You push the door open slowly, scanning the dimly lit interior
                for any signs of danger. The air inside is stale and musty, and you can hear the creaks and groans of
                old wooden floorboards beneath your feet.

                You motion for your group to follow you, and you move cautiously into the building, your senses on high
                alert. The interior is cluttered with old furniture and debris, but you spot a staircase leading up to
                the second floor and what looks like a reinforced door at the far end of the room. You can't help but
                think that the upper floors might provide a better vantage point to assess the situation, but the
                reinforced door looks like it might provide a more secure place to hole up.</h1>

            <a href="#2" class="link s_var">Make for the reinforced door and try to barricade yourselves in</a>
