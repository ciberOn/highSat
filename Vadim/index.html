            <h1>You are in a desolate city street, surrounded by ruins and debris. The sky is a deep shade of crimson, and the air is thick with the smell of smoke and ozone. The alien invasion has been going on for hours, and it seems like the world as you knew it is on the brink of collapse.

                You've managed to find a small group of survivors, including a young nurse named Sarah, a former soldier named Jack, and a brilliant scientist named Dr. Patel. You've barricaded yourselves inside a abandoned building, trying to catch your breath and come up with a plan.
                
                As you peek out the window, you see a group of aliens patrolling the street. They're tall, slender creatures with long arms and large, black eyes. They seem to be scanning the area, searching for any signs of human life.
                </h1>
            <a href="#1" class="link f_var">**Head to the armory**: You remember a nearby armory that might have some heavy
                artillery to take down the aliens. It's a risk, but it could be worth it.</a>
                <a href="" class="link s_var">**Find a safe haven**: You need to get your group to safety. You spot a nearby building
                    that looks like it might be secure. It's not ideal, but it's better than staying out in the open.
                </a>
                <a href="" class="link t_var">**Fight back**: You're not going to let the aliens take over without a fight. You grab
                    a nearby gun and prepare to take on the invaders head-on.

            <h1>**Head to the armory**: You remember a nearby armory that might have some heavy artillery to take down the aliens. It's a risk, but it could be worth it. You sprint through the deserted streets, dodging debris and avoiding the eerie gazes of the alien's surveillance drones. The armory's sign creaks in the wind as you approach the entrance, a faded logo of a proud eagle now a mocking reminder of humanity's crumbling defenses.

                As you burst through the door, the dimly lit interior reveals rows of steel shelves stacked with crates and dusty weapon racks. The air is thick with the smell of gunpowder and stale sweat. You navigate the narrow aisles, your footsteps echoing off the metal walls. Your eyes scan the shelves, searching for anything that might give you an edge against the extraterrestrial invaders.
