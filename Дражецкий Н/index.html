                Title: The Enchanted Isle Quest<br>
                Introduction:<br>
                Welcome, brave adventurer! Your journey begins on the windswept shores of the Enchanted Isle, a
                mysterious land shrouded in legend and magic. Famous for its flourishing flora and elusive fauna, this
                isle is rumored to be home to artifacts of untold power, hidden oceans of tranquility, and dark,
                forbidding secrets.<br>
                Quest Overview:<br>
                Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover the secrets of the Étherstone, a mythical
                gem said to absorb the very essence of magic itself. Whispers of its power have drawn many seekers,
                leading a lively variety of characters to its hauntingly beautiful shores.

                Starting Point: Beach of Whispers<br>

                As the sun rises, casting golden rays on the rippling waves, you receive an intriguing invitation from
                Ilaria, the wise oracle of the isle. She speaks to you in voice both tender and urgent, her eyes
                reflecting the island’s enchanting hues. “The Étherstone will align with the next full moon, creating a
                gate to the Dream Realm. To harness its power, you must complete three trials and gather enchanted Astra
                Blossoms hidden throughout the isle.

                Trial of the Forest Guardians: Venture into the Verdant Wood, where mischievous

                solving her riddles. Use your wits to charm the Blossom from her glade, or risk being forever trapped in
